# Hello World

Performance optimization in React Native apps involves multiple strategies to enhance user experience. Techniques such as lazy loading, minimizing re-renders, and using native modules can significantly improve the responsiveness of your application. Understanding the performance bottlenecks in your app is the first step towards effective optimization.

```javascript
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Optimized performance!");
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return <div>My React Native Component</div>;
}
```
