Search engine optimization (SEO) is essential for improving the visibility of your Next.js projects. Implementing strategies such as proper use of meta tags, structured data, and optimizing for mobile devices can help your site rank higher in search results. Using the `next/head` component allows you to manage the head section of your pages effectively.

```javascript
import Head from "next/head";

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>My Page Title</title>
        <meta name="description" content="This is my page description." />
      </Head>
      <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```
